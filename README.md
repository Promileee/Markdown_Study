This repository is used to store a series of note files written while learning Markdown syntax.

The Markdown study notes stored in this repository are based on the learning from the [Markdown Tutorial](https://markdown.com.cn/). Thanks to the selfless sharing of the `Markdown Tutorial`.

## Markdown Heading Syntax
In [Markdown_heading_grammar.md](https://github.com/Promileee/Markdown_Study/blob/main/Markdown_heading_grammar.md), you can find a series of operations related to creating and editing headings in Markdown. Markdown's hierarchical headings are particularly suitable for content like project introductions that require clear hierarchical relationships.

## Markdown Emphasis Syntax

The emphasis operations in Markdown mainly include the following:

## Markdown Quote Syntax

## Markdown List Syntax
In [Markdown_list_grammar.md](https://github.com/Promileee/Markdown_Study/blob/main/Markdown_list_grammar.md), you can find content related to using lists in Markdown. Lists in Markdown can be divided into ordered lists and unordered lists.

## Markdown Code Syntax
In [Markdown_code_grammar.md](https://github.com/Promileee/Markdown_Study/blob/main/Markdown_code_grammar.md), you can find syntax related to representing code in Markdown, as well as using code blocks to reference code.

## Markdown Horizontal Rule Syntax
In [Markdown_horizontal_rule_grammar.md](https://github.com/Promileee/Markdown_Study/blob/main/Markdown_horizontal_rule_grammar.md), you can find content related to using horizontal rules in Markdown.

## Markdown Link Syntax
In [Markdown_link_grammar.md](https://github.com/Promileee/Markdown_Study/blob/main/Markdown_link_grammar.md), you can find syntax related to using links in Markdown, which can turn URLs or email addresses into clickable links or store them in hyperlinks.

## Markdown Image Syntax
In [Markdown_picture_grammar.md](https://github.com/Promileee/Markdown_Study/blob/main/Markdown_picture_grammar.md), you can find syntax related to adding images in Markdown, as well as how to add hyperlinks to images.

## Markdown Escape Syntax

## Conclusion
At this point, the content related to Markdown syntax is not exhaustive, but it is sufficient to meet the needs of most use cases. Due to the author's time constraints, further in-depth learning will be postponed for now.

Additionally, `GitHub` supports using LaTeX to input formulas in Markdown. This will certainly be useful in the future, but since LaTeX is a complete input language in itself, updates on this will be made later, and the link will be appended to the end of this article.

Finally, Markdown is a language and a tool, but the tool itself is not the goal. Learning Markdown is like a painter acquiring a brush or a craftsman picking up a chisel. The value of the tool is not significant on its own; its value lies in the creations of those who use it. I look forward to the vast possibilities that Markdown can help create.
